# haunted-manor-scorecard

Interactive scorecard web app

An interactive scorecard built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Allows users to scan a QR code with a mobile device and input values as they play a 15-hole minigolf
course in Victoria, BC. App will add the scores that are input in realtime. Made to be mainly compatible with mobile devices as this will be the only instance of playing the game, though will work on desktop with non-optimized styling issues. Currently hosted on my GitHub account and embedded on https://www.hauntedmanorvictoria.com/score-card for live use.
